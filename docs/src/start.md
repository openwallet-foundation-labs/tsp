# Getting started

This book contains guides, helping to get started with the
Rust Trust Spanning Protocol (TSP) implementation.

See [https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-tsp-specification/](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-tsp-specification/) for the TSP Specification.

## Quick start

See the [web interface](./web-interface.md) to get started with TSP without installing
any software. The web interface is intended to showcase the direct communication mode of TSP,
the CESR encoding of messages and for testing purposes.

## CLI

See the [command line interface](./web-interface.md) guide to get started
with the _test_ CLI for TSP.
The TSP CLI is an examplke application of Rust TSP that helps testing
the direct, nested and routed mode of TSP.
There is some support infrastructure deployed on tsp-test.org in order
to get started quickly.
