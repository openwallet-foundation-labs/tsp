# Installation

To get started with the CLI, first install Rust. See [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). The fastest way is running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

After Rust is installed, you should be able to run cargo:

```sh
cargo version
```

Output:

```
cargo 1.89.0 (c24e10642 2025-06-23) # for example
```

Installing the TSP CLI program:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/openwallet-foundation-labs/tsp.git examples --bin tsp
```

You should be able to run `tsp`:

```sh
